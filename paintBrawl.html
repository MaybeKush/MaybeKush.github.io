  <h2  class = "animateSplatDown">What is Paint Brawl, you ask?</h2>
  
  <div class="text-wrapper"><p class = "animateSplatUp">Paint Brawl is a game that I(alone) worked on for Brackeys
    Game Jam 2024.1. Everything is made from scratch in Unity with the exceptions of Sounds. The game was made
    in 7 days.

    In this you spawn in a desolate room, you keep opening doors as you fight unexpected enemies with A LOT of variety
    (atleast for 7 days of work). After completing each room, you earn some coins which you can spend on strengthening
    yourself. It's a brutally hard game (atleast that's what I was aiming for), enemeis dodge your bullets, they walk
    away from your bullet's trajectory and well, some of them are most unexpected in their attacks. The only thing
    that can help you survive is your full attention and quick response to anything they throw at you.

  <h2 class = "animateSplatDown">Technical Challenges</h2>
  <div class="text-wrapper"><p class = "animateSplatUp"> These are some of the fun technical challenges I accomplished
      <br><br>- <b>Writing clean/modular code</b> so that I can have as many monsters with the most complexity and keep it all 
      organised and understable to human eye. This helped me a lot since I made 4 bosses and 1 mini boss in last few
      hours before the jam ended. Clean code saved me SO much time when needed the most.
      <br><br>- <b>Making boss run away from bullets </b> was very fun to make. So I calculate the trajectory of bullets
      by having their positions and directions. Then I extend a line and calculate if the boss is on the left side or
      right side of trajectory, which then gives me where to move. Then I simply get a perpendicular direction to player
      and move to wherever the cumulative sum of all their trajectories and respective running direction points.
      <br><br>- <b>Used almost all raw maths instead of Unity's functions </b> because the current me thinks it's fun.
      <br><br>- <b>WebGL </b> was a pain but had to do it for the jam. Apparently a type of functions just don't work
      and there's no documentation, no bug reports, no data of it on the whole internet. Just had to use another type
      of asynchronous functions instead of default C# async functions (which make it all so neat).
