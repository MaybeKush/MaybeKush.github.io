  <h2 class = "animateSplatDown">What role did I play in making of the game?</h2>
  <div class="text-wrapper"><p class = "animateSplatUp">
    The client wanted a Tower Defense game with a catch, Path that enemies follow is not fixed. That was the baseline,
    I helped him define more intricate mechanics, improved game design a bit.<br> Helped brainstorm and develop the whole
    project from start to end. It's on Steam now, but since neither of us were into marketing, the launch wasn't as
    great as it could have been. The game's still great though.
    <br><br>
    A* pathfinding algorithm was used to make monsters choose the shortest available path.
    <br><br>
    What I did :<br>
    - Programming<br>
    - Aesthetics Direction<br>
    - Sound Direction<br>
    - Optimization<br>
    - Game Feel<br>
    - Game Design (some mechanics)<br>
