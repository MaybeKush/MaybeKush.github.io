  <h2>What is S.O.S. Squad, you ask?</h2>
  
  <p>In this online multiplayer game you try to assemble your ideal squad to be stranded with by trading character cards, and offering up some good stuff!
  <br><br> You are given to chose the people you want to be strangded with, it's upto you then to gather all of them from others which got some of your 
  cards because of random shuffling. The first one to gather their squad will be declared the winner.<br>You can offer others SPAM and others can take
   it and if they can manage to collect 25 or more SPAM, they will be declared the winner.

  <h2>What role did I play in making of the game?</h2>
  <p>I was incharge of making the multiplayer part and all the mechanics so everything you see is done by me except the UI art, which was provided by the 
  client and the UI coding which was done by my friend. It's not that I couldn't do the UI coding as well, but the time limit for this project was 2 weeks
   only which is quite short for making a full game, so I decided not to risk it and asked one of my friend to assist me and now in hindsight, it was a
   good decision.<br>The game was made in Unity and the networking used for this game was Photon Unity Networking 2, aka PUN 2. This project sure was a 
   challenge to make and fix all the mechanics and bugs within 2 weeks.
