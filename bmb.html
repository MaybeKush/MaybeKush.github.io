  <h2>What role did I play in making of the game?</h2>
  <p>Well, I did everything, every single thing is made by me because I decided to make this game alone. Everything except sounds, some sounds
   are royalty free and downloaded from the internet because why not? Except that, everything, including multiplayer networking, fixing bugs, UI,
   icons, the pixel art of guns and effects all is done by me.<br> One thing is worth mentioning, that the AI, the base AI is not done by me either,
   I used the A Start AI package in unity to find the ways but, that doesn't mean everything AI was done by that package, I still needed to make the
   bot go to the path that AI found, fixed some bugs, and made how they should shoot so they are neither over powerful nor boring to play with. All
   that package did was to find a path among a grid, I could have done that myself but I decided to save some time and used an already built system.
